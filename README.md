Running the Project with GKE, Node.js App, ArgoCD, and CI/CD Pipeline
This guide outlines the organized steps to run our project, which involves creating GKE clusters, deploying a Node.js application, integrating with ArgoCD, and setting up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
Prerequisites:
•	GCP Project: A Google Cloud Platform project with billing enabled.
•	Terraform: Installed and configured with our GCP credentials.
•	Helm: Installed on our local machine.
•	Docker Hub account If you plan to push your Node.js application image to a private registry.
•	Git repository: A Git repository to store our Terraform configurations, Helm chart, and Node.js application code.
Steps:
1.	Project Structure:
o	Create a root directory for our project.
o	Organize subdirectories for:
	charts: Our Helm chart for the Node.js application.
	clusters (dev, test, prod): Terraform configurations for each GKE cluster environment.
	deployments: Deployment manifests for ArgoCD and Prometheus Operator (optional).
	exporters : Exporter configurations for monitoring (e.g., Node Exporter).
	grafana : Terraform configurations for Grafana deployment.
	modules : Reusable modules for Terraform configurations.
	ci.yml: Our GitHub Actions workflow file for CI/CD automation.
	main.tf: The main Terraform configuration file.
	outputs.tf: Outputs for cluster information from Terraform.
	roles : RBAC role definitions for our clusters.
	terraform.tfvars or terraform.vars (optional): Variable definition files for Terraform.

2.	Configure Terraform:
o	Create a terraform.tfvars or terraform.vars file (or separate files per environment) to define variables for your project:
	Project ID
	Region
	Cluster names (dev, test, prod)
	Initial node count for each cluster
	Cluster admin passwords (stored securely)
	VPC network details 
	Firewall rule name 
	RBAC configuration 
	Node.js Helm chart details
	ArgoCD project name
	ArgoCD Git repository URL
	Prometheus and Grafana configurations (optional)
o	Define the main Terraform configuration in main.tf to:
	Initialize the GCP provider
	Reference variable definitions
	Create the VPC network (optional)
	Define firewall rules (optional)
	Call a reusable module (modules/gke_cluster.tf) for creating GKE clusters with RBAC bindings (optional)
	Deploy ArgoCD and Prometheus Operator (optional)
	Deploy Grafana (optional)
	Output cluster information (IP addresses, endpoints)
3.	Develop Node.js Application:
o	Develop your Node.js application code.
o	Package your application into a Docker image using a Dockerfile within the charts directory.
o	Create a Helm chart in the charts directory to package your application and deployment configurations.
4.	CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions:
o	Create a ci.yml file in your Git repository to define the GitHub Actions workflow.
o	The workflow should:
	Check out the code from your Git repository.
	If using a private Docker registry, log in using Docker credentials stored as GitHub Actions secrets.
	Build and push your Node.js application image to the container registry.
	Use Terraform to apply configurations for each cluster environment (dev, test, prod). This might involve iterating through a list of cluster names and using environment variables for specific configurations.
	Deploy your application using ArgoCD with the Helm chart, referencing the built image and Git commit SHA for version control.
	Optionally, run tests for your Node.js application.
	Optionally, update Grafana dashboards with relevant metrics.
5.	Run the Project:
o	Initialize Terraform in each cluster directory (clusters/dev, clusters/test, clusters/prod):
Bash
cd clusters/dev
terraform init
Apply Terraform configurations for each environment (replace with your actual environment names):
Bash
terraform apply -auto-approve (for dev environment)
cd ../test
terraform apply -auto-approve (for test environment)
cd ../prod
terraform apply -auto-approve (for prod environment)
